# Newton-Method
Algorithm to solve user-given polynomials

To start, the file "GUI" must be executed. Now you should see a GUI
in which you can enter the degree of your polynomial.
After the text field has been filled and the button "Set degree" has been pressed, a corresponding number of 
text fields will appear in which the coefficients can now be entered.
If finally the button "Confirm coefficients" is pressed,
all (found) zeros are displayed. For a further calculation
simply confirm the new degree first and then the new coefficients.
No input should lead to a crash of the program. If this is
the case or if a zero is output incorrectly or incompletely, please report this.
